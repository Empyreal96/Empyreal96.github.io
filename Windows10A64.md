# **Windows 10 ARM64 Optimized**	-	Home

### What is it and why go to this effort?

If you have reached this page, then I will presume you have heard of the Windows On Arm Project (WoA Project *Insert link*) and their incredible work in providing the tools and drivers to allow us Lumia 950/XL owners to have a full Windows 10 experience on the device.. but because, for many reasons, it can be slow at times, the situation is worse with the standard 950 compared to the XL due to Windows 10 not initializing the 'big' CPU of the 950..

This is where I am attempting to create an Optimized and Speedy image to deploy with WoA Deployer on either the 950, XL or Pi3 (Or any ARM64 device as long as you have drivers for the hardware you are deploying to) which aims to keep Average User features like Microsoft Store, Metro Apps and Most of the Default experience the same, just a bit lighter 'Under the Hood'

###### Tools used to create Image:

- DISM++ (*link*)
- WinReducer X 100 (Free Version)
- RegEdit
- Notepad++

#### What Is different?

- Unneeded Windows Services Disabled, Some Removed
- Removed Built-In Metro UI Apps (Considered Bloat)
- Disabled Telemetry Tasks and Blocked Telemetry IP Addresses (*Credit and link*)
- Removed potentially 'Bad' Updates
- Variety of tweaks aimed at performance

###### A FULL Changelog can be found Here

#### Requirements:

- WoA Deployer (*Link*)
- Windows Device Recovery Tool
- Prior Knowledge of using WoA Project
