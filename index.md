# **Hello World!**

#### Forward:

I'm not a developer or anything fancy, just a hobbyist.. My main focus in my early days was jailbreaking and hacking my old iPod touch to run Android using OpeniBoot, then I moved onto Android.. That will be a story for later as I have achieved a fair bit from creating a barebones Android with a CLI style launcher to running Linux through a chroot and running Windows 10 with QEMU-KVM with virtio working through Spice.

Now my interests are with Windows 10 ARM64, Batch Scripting and C# (This one isn't priority at the moment)
